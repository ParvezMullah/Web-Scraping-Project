This distributed ledger technology keeps track of all the changes ever made to it, virtually eliminating the possibility of fraud and providing unparalleled transparency. These two factors create inviolable trust between the opposite parties in a transaction and does so without the need for an expensive third party. It is this inherent feature of trust that makes blockchain a radical disruptor of FinTech and P2P applications.</p><h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"30fa\" name=\"30fa\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Peer-to-Peer Reinvented</strong></h4><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"e527\" name=\"e527\">Blockchain technology disrupts many traditional industries by offering a faster, cheaper, more secure, and more effective transactions between peers. What used to require expensive intermediaries or third-parties can be now carried out easily through blockchain thanks to the implementation of smart contracts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d99\" name=\"2d99\">Smart contracts are the idea behind the so-called <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/aerum-technologies/blockchain-2-0-evolution-in-process-e303527e9bba\" href=\"https://medium.com/aerum-technologies/blockchain-2-0-evolution-in-process-e303527e9bba\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain 2.0</a> concept. They represent a covenant between two parties which is written and secured using a programming language. The contracts are automatically executed as soon as the specified triggers are pulled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e82a\" name=\"e82a\">This dramatically reduces the need for third-party moderation throughout a broad range of different industries. Hence, blockchain’s disruptive capacity for the P2P economy, and FinTech in general.</p><h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"d3e9\" name=\"d3e9\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">A Few Examples</strong></h4><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"2b7d\" name=\"2b7d\">While, in theory, any industry can benefit from blockchain technologies, there are certain fields which can be positively, even radically transformed.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\" id=\"f700\" name=\"f700\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Money Transfer</strong></li></ul><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\" id=\"1aff\" name=\"1aff\">Having to send a certain amount of money to a distant relative halfway across the world is a situation that many of us are familiar with. The process takes an uncomfortable amount of time and imposes annoying fees for a task that should be simple: sending money to another person.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"497d\" name=\"497d\">Blockchain technology takes away all the hurdles when it comes to transferring money. Parties are now able to send funds without having to use the services of third-party intermediaries (banks or other financial services providers) at little to no cost and in little to no time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f886\" name=\"f886\">And as mentioned above, the blockchain keeps a record of all transactions, which allows users to be completely certain of the movements of their money.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\" id=\"50a8\" name=\"50a8\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Transportation &amp; Logistics</strong></li></ul><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\" id=\"a234\" name=\"a234\">Blockchain technologies can also dramatically empower the transportation and logistics industries. The technology is already being picked up by traditional institutions in the field, including major players like Maersk and Walmart. In Australia, for example, the Commonwealth Bank recently <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/commonwealth-bank-of-australia-ships-17-tons-of-almonds-using-blockchain-technology/\" href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/commonwealth-bank-of-australia-ships-17-tons-of-almonds-using-blockchain-technology/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shipped 17 tons of almonds</a> using blockchain technology.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"58b6\" name=\"58b6\">This enabled them to track important factors such as the cargo’s current location, temperature, and humidity within the containers, and other values in real time.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\" id=\"735d\" name=\"735d\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Insurance Payments</strong></li></ul><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\" id=\"ce87\" name=\"ce87\">Blockchain technology can also reduce the costs of operating P2P insurance networks. This is because it has the potential to increase transparency, cut down administrative costs, and reduce fraud.</p><h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"98ba\" name=\"98ba\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">What’s AERUM’s Role in All This?</strong></h4><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"a62b\" name=\"a62b\">Blockchain technology, despite its undeniable disruptive potential, is still quite new, and relatively untested in real-world applications. Much of the reason for this is that the majority of existing networks are unable to support the number of transactions needed to cater to the requirements of widespread public and enterprise-grade adoption.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0367\" name=\"0367\">Take Ethereum, for example — the industry leader in terms of deployed solutions. It can currently handle only 20 transactions per second. When it comes to enterprise applications on a global scale, it goes without saying that this is not nearly fast enough to be a practical, day-to-day solution.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"144d\" name=\"144d\">This is where AERUM comes in, as a reliable and fast blockchain platform which is free for the end user.

Evert tradable asset needs a market where it can be traded and that is what these exchanges do, they facilitate cryptocurrency commerce by virtue of their platforms service solutions. Within the world of cryptocurrency exchanges, there are basically two types of exchange platform; centralized and decentralized. The focus of this article is on decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platforms.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"d388\" name=\"d388\">What are Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges?</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"c5f1\" name=\"c5f1\">To understand what a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange is, it is necessary to first know what a cryptocurrency exchange does. Within the digital currency market, a cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that enables the conversion of fiat money to cryptocurrency and vice-versa as well as the conversion of different cryptocurrency pairs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b975\" name=\"b975\">A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange is one in which the architecture of the platform has no central controlling server (or bundle of servers). As a result, no third-party escrow intermediary is required to hold the funds of the participants in the exchange transaction.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"eb93\" name=\"eb93\">Differences Between Centralized and Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h3><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3\" id=\"1e9d\" name=\"1e9d\">· Control of Funds</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"8da4\" name=\"8da4\">Users of centralized exchange platforms make deposits to the exchange in order to facilitate an exchange/trading transaction. These funds are controlled by the centralized exchanged service. This means that order-books, as well as custody, is firmly in the hands of the centralized platform service</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ee2\" name=\"3ee2\">In a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform, users transact directly with their peers without the need for a central server. There is a no centralized platform service that is in possession of order books and custody. Funds are therefore controlled by the users and participants in the platform.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"1a92\" name=\"1a92\">· Anonymity</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"6e67\" name=\"6e67\">Some centralized platforms used to allow anonymous trading accounts on their platforms. However, the raft of government regulations that have sprung in recent months has led to the adherence to strict KYC and AML laws. It is difficult to trade anonymously on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange platform.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e6fa\" name=\"e6fa\">Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platforms are all about anonymity. Consider them to be the distributed blockchain-equivalent of centralized exchanges.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"4314\" name=\"4314\">· Authentication</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"0c1b\" name=\"0c1b\">Users of centralized crypto exchanges rely on the platform to authenticate and authorize their transactions.

We ask, and are asked, about our interests in crypto and we discuss what got us interested and when. Everyone says, “I’m not a Bitcoin millionaire.” Then the same thought gets passed around; “I wish I’d gotten in earlier,” we say. It’s a sort of litany. And it’s true, I really do wish I’d bought Bitcoin five, six, or eight years ago. Most of us had heard something about it back then but for whatever reason we didn’t jump in. In my own case I remember thinking “$100, too late to get in. I doubt they’ll go higher.” Of course the assumption is that we wouldn’t have sold out at double or even at 10X but would still have our stake today, at around $6,500 per.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0cde\" name=\"0cde\">That’s the problem, spotting a moonshot while it’s still on the ground. Back then, of course, we didn’t know the value could even go so high. Today we do. If only I could go back and buy at least $100 or $1000 worth, why I’d be….</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"57a5\" name=\"57a5\">Perhaps some of us bought into ICOs and perhaps some of us even made some money on them. Ahhh, if only we were back in ‘17… but those days are gone too. Right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"38cf\" name=\"38cf\">The problem with ICOs is that they have no fundamental values on which to base estimates of future value. When choosing a stock, even an IPO, you can look at company’s performance, a real product, and maybe even current sales. Underwriters of new stock issues don’t invest in idea level startups. With ICOs though future promise is almost entirely based on hype and faith; spray and pray. We’ve come to accept that to get involved early enough to hope for 10X, 100X, or more we have to go on nothing more than a whitepaper and team description.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6cfd\" name=\"6cfd\">To make the issue even worse, the vast majority of tokens have absolutely no use other than making money for the startup issuing them. Even if the company holds back a portion of them and locks them up to prevent dumping for a month or year after listing on exchanges, even if the company depends on their future value for their own profits, the tokens are nothing more than holders of market set by arbitrary value. If they drop by 99% the company has the proceeds of the sale in hand and the future token value will have little or no effect on the company’s core business. The startup has gained funding but the token holders will never share in the profits, or have a say in company decisions. Perhaps the token is a medium of exchange in a closed network but that is rarely a necessity — any other token, and sometimes even fiat, could take their place.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6736\" name=\"6736\">The exception to this is AERUM. It’s another reason why I joined the team (another is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.uxstrategy.eu/experience-design/crypto-ux-cost-uncertainty-why-aerum-will-be-the-third-largest-crypto-in-three-years/\" href=\"https://www.uxstrategy.eu/experience-design/crypto-ux-cost-uncertainty-why-aerum-will-be-the-third-largest-crypto-in-three-years/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AERUM’s UX and business focus discussed here</a>). In solving the difficulty of transaction fees for the end user they, perhaps inadvertently, created something almost magic; a basis of fundamental value for their XRM token which also happens to be a Free Money Factory. Like any factory, its own value depends on the value of its output. That is the fundamental value which will give XRM its positive price pressure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c99a\" name=\"c99a\">The EIP-20 XRM token generates free transactions in the form of Aero tokens (the GAS equivalent in this system). If the holder is a business that needs the transactions, they can apply their Aero to their customers’ transactions. If the holder doesn’t need the transactions, say if the holder is an investor, the Aero can be sold to those who need them, for ETH.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"37b5\" name=\"37b5\">Let’s take a look at the investor scenarios a bit closer. Let’s say Ms. CleverInvestor buys XRM. Every day her XRM generate Aero. She doesn’t need the Aero so she sells them and gets ETH. She still holds her XRM, all of them. In effect her XRM are a money factory. XRM is cryptocurrency that literally makes, as in manufactures, money — Every single day. She doesn’t need to worry about buying low and selling high; timing the extremely volatile crypto market is simply nothing she needs to concern herself with. She sells low and she sells high — the next day she sells again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa77\" name=\"aa77\">AREUM hasn’t launched its network yet — that’s coming shortly, mid January of 2019, so obviously there is no demand for Aero yet. Like all business, there is a risk that there may never be. In other words, we are in a stage very like the one everyone wishes they bought into five or eight years ago with Bitcoin. The future is uncertain. The value of XRM is low.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c79\" name=\"2c79\">The core differences though, are:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\" id=\"7d91\" name=\"7d91\">XRM plays a fundamental role in the Aero tokenomic model, that of generating Aero.</li><li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\" id=\"7e89\" name=\"7e89\">The value of transactions, as reflected in the price of Aero vs ETH (or other currencies) will provide a fundamental support floor to the XRM price.</li><li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\" id=\"0829\" name=\"0829\">Unlike the case of Bitcoin in 2011, we <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">know</em> that crypto can rise by 10X or 1,000X or more.</li></ul><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\" id=\"e68f\" name=\"e68f\">Ultimately, crypto investments are risky. Calling the timing or the token is hard. The cost of making the wrong call is often complete collapse, 100% loss. But the potential in making the right call is unlike anything we’ve seen before. This we know. The value of tokens with no function or fundamental value has soared. How you predict the future value trajectory for a token with the unique properties of core tokenomic function and genuine fundamental value, that is capable of providing a passive income in ETH, in perpetuity, is up to you. The risk, as it was with Bitcoin, is real. The benefits and profits potentially outstrip Bitcoin, even Ethereum.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f0a5\" name=\"f0a5\">===</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"9a36\" name=\"9a36\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://aerum.com\" href=\"http://aerum.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The AERUM system</a> really is quite cool.
